# Machine Learning Foundations 

> This repo contains my solution for the machine learning course introduced by Washington university through Coursera.



## About This course
> the course follows the case study approach in which you learn by doing. the course uses Python as a programming language and uses turicreate library instead of pandas(to deal with dataset) and sklearn(to train your model) which is much easier. through the course, I was exposed to 5 case studies with all the associated challenges and how to overcome them.

1. Regression:
> predicting houses prices in this case study, I created models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...). This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.

2. Classification:
> Analyzing Sentiment in this case, study, I created models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...). I built an intelligent restaurant review system that predicts whether a review was positive or negative.

3. Clustering and Similarity:
> Retrieving Documents in this case study, I built a model which takes a document, suppose a document that talks about Messi, and recommend all similar documents that talk about the same thing.

4. Recommendation:
> Recommending Products in this case study, I built a popularity product recommendation that recommends the most popular product. also, I built a personalized product recommendation that recommends the products depending on the user's past purchase.

5. Deep Learning:
> Searching for Images in this final case study, I worked on an image classification model that takes an image and classifies it. the second part of this case study was image retrieval which takes an image and finds all similar images to this image.
